This one\n  contains the most complete documentation, and the others refer to\n  this one.  They all differ in the function that they are intended to\n  validate, and a few other details, which will be collected in one\n  place here for function validating-pop so one can quickly see the\n  differences between validating-pop and the other validating-*\n  functions.\n\n      good example f: clojure.core/pop\n      opts map: (get @d/debug-opts :pop)\n\n  The first argument can be any function f.  f is expected to take\n  arguments and return a value equal to what clojure.core/pop would,\n  given the argument coll.\n\n  validating-pop will first make a copy of the seq of items in coll,\n  as a safety precaution, because some kinds of incorrect\n  implementations of pop could mutate their input argument.  That\n  would be a bug, of course, but aiding a developer in detecting bugs\n  is the reason validating-pop exists.  It uses the function\n  copying-seq to do this, which takes at least linear time in the size\n  of coll.\n\n  It will then calculate a sequence that is = to the expected return\n  value, e.g. for pop, all items in coll except the last one.\n\n  Then validating-pop will call (f coll), then call copying-seq on the\n  return value.\n\n  If the expected and returned sequences are not =, then a map\n  containing details about the arguments and actual return value is\n  created and passed to d/record-failure-data, which appends the map\n  to the end of a vector that is the value of an atom named\n  d/failure-data.  An exception is thrown if (:continue-on-error opts)\n  is logical false, with ex-data equal to this same map of error data.\n\n  If the expected and actual sequences are the same, no state is\n  modified and no exception is thrown.\n\n  If validating-pop does not throw an exception, the return value is\n  (f coll).","^D","^U","^E",817],["^ ","^V",["^1",[1]],"^9",945,"^W",["^ "],"^:",19,"^;",true,"^<",883,"^=",883,"^X","^?","^>","~$checking-pop","^Z","^[","^@",1,"^A",7,"^10","^[","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/core.rrb-vector/0.1.1/core.rrb-vector-0.1.1.jar!/clojure/core/rrb_vector/debug.cljs","^C",16,"^11",["[coll]"],"^13","These two namespace aliases will be used later in this\n  documentation:\n\n      (require '[clojure.core.rrb-vector.debug :as d])\n      (require '[clojure.core.rrb-vector.debug-platform-dependent :as pd])\n\n  checking-pop passes its argument to clojure.core/pop, and if it\n  returns, it returns whatever clojure.core/pop does.

All inherited methods,\n  generated methods, and init and main functions (see :methods, :init,\n  and :main below) will be found similarly prefixed. By default, the\n  static initializer for the generated class will attempt to load the\n  Clojure support code for the class as a resource from the classpath,\n  e.g. in the example case, ``org/mydomain/MyClass__init.class``.

ASSERTIONS\n\n   The core of the library is the \"is\" macro, which lets you make\n   assertions of any arbitrary expression:\n\n   (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))\n   (is (instance? Integer 256))\n   (is (.startsWith \"abcde\" \"ab\"))\n\n   You can type an \"is\" expression directly at the REPL, which will\n   print a message if it fails.\n\n       user> (is (= 5 (+ 2 2)))\n\n       FAIL in  (:1)\n       expected: (= 5 (+ 2 2))\n         actual: (not (= 5 4))\n       false\n\n   The \"expected:\" line shows you the original expression, and the\n   \"actual:\" shows you what actually happened.  In this case, it\n   shows that (+ 2 2) returned 4, which is not = to 5.  Finally, the\n   \"false\" on the last line is the value returned from the\n   expression.  The \"is\" macro always returns the result of the\n   inner expression.\n\n   There are two special assertions for testing exceptions.  The\n   \"(is (thrown? c ...))\" form tests if an exception of class c is\n   thrown:\n\n   (is (thrown? ArithmeticException (/ 1 0))) \n\n   \"(is (thrown-with-msg? c re ...))\" does the same thing and also\n   tests that the message on the exception matches the regular\n   expression re:\n\n   (is (thrown-with-msg? ArithmeticException #\"Divide by zero\"\n                         (/ 1 0)))\n\n   DOCUMENTING TESTS\n\n   \"is\" takes an optional second argument, a string describing the\n   assertion.  This message will be included in the error report.\n\n   (is (= 5 (+ 2 2)) \"Crazy arithmetic\")\n\n   In addition, you can document groups of assertions with the\n   \"testing\" macro, which takes a string followed by any number of\n   assertions.  The string will be included in failure reports.\n   Calls to \"testing\" may be nested, and all of the strings will be\n   joined together with spaces in the final report, in a style\n   similar to RSpec <http://rspec.info/>\n\n   (testing \"Arithmetic\"\n     (testing \"with positive integers\"\n       (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))\n       (is (= 7 (+ 3 4))))\n     (testing \"with negative integers\"\n       (is (= -4 (+ -2 -2)))\n       (is (= -1 (+ 3 -4)))))\n\n   Note that, unlike RSpec, the \"testing\" macro may only be used\n   INSIDE a \"deftest\" or \"with-test\" form (see below).\n\n\n   DEFINING TESTS\n\n   There are two ways to define tests.  The \"with-test\" macro takes\n   a defn or def form as its first argument, followed by any number\n   of assertions.  The tests will be stored as metadata on the\n   definition.\n\n   (with-test\n       (defn my-function [x y]\n         (+ x y))\n     (is (= 4 (my-function 2 2)))\n     (is (= 7 (my-function 3 4))))\n\n   As of Clojure SVN rev. 1221, this does not work with defmacro.\n   See http://code.google.com/p/clojure/issues/detail?id=51\n\n   The other way lets you define tests separately from the rest of\n   your code, even in a different namespace:\n\n   (deftest addition\n     (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))\n     (is (= 7 (+ 3 4))))\n\n   (deftest subtraction\n     (is (= 1 (- 4 3)))\n     (is (= 3 (- 7 4))))\n\n   This creates functions named \"addition\" and \"subtraction\", which\n   can be called like any other function.  Therefore, tests can be\n   grouped and composed, in a style similar to the test framework in\n   Peter Seibel's \"Practical Common Lisp\"\n   <http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-building-a-unit-test-framework.html>\n\n   (deftest arithmetic\n     (addition)\n     (subtraction))\n\n   The names of the nested tests will be joined in a list, like\n   \"(arithmetic addition)\", in failure reports.  You can use nested\n   tests to set up a context shared by several tests.\n\n\n   RUNNING TESTS\n\n   Run tests with the function \"(run-tests namespaces...)\":\n\n   (run-tests 'your.namespace 'some.other.namespace)\n\n   If you don't specify any namespaces, the current namespace is\n   used.  To run all tests in all namespaces, use \"(run-all-tests)\".\n\n   By default, these functions will search for all tests defined in\n   a namespace and run them in an undefined order.  However, if you\n   are composing tests, as in the \"arithmetic\" example above, you\n   probably do not want the \"addition\" and \"subtraction\" tests run\n   separately.  In that case, you must define a special function\n   named \"test-ns-hook\" that runs your tests in the correct order:\n\n   (defn test-ns-hook []\n     (arithmetic))\n\n   Note: test-ns-hook prevents execution of fixtures (see below).\n\n\n   OMITTING TESTS FROM PRODUCTION CODE\n\n   You can bind the variable \"*load-tests*\" to false when loading or\n   compiling code in production.  This will prevent any tests from\n   being created by \"with-test\" or \"deftest\".\n\n\n   FIXTURES\n\n   Fixtures allow you to run code before and after tests, to set up\n   the context in which tests should be run.\n\n   A fixture is just a function that calls another function passed as\n   an argument.  It looks like this:\n\n   (defn my-fixture [f]\n      Perform setup, establish bindings, whatever.\n     (f)  Then call the function we were passed.\n      Tear-down / clean-up code here.\n    )\n\n   Fixtures are attached to namespaces in one of two ways.  \"each\"\n   fixtures are run repeatedly, once for each test function created\n   with \"deftest\" or \"with-test\".  \"each\" fixtures are useful for\n   establishing a consistent before/after state for each test, like\n   clearing out database tables.\n\n   \"each\" fixtures can be attached to the current namespace like this:\n   (use-fixtures :each fixture1 fixture2 ...)\n   The fixture1, fixture2 are just functions like the example above.\n   They can also be anonymous functions, like this:\n   (use-fixtures :each (fn [f] setup... (f) cleanup...))\n\n   The other kind of fixture, a \"once\" fixture, is only run once,\n   around ALL the tests in the namespace.  \"once\" fixtures are useful\n   for tasks that only need to be performed once, like establishing\n   database connections, or for time-consuming tasks.\n\n   Attach \"once\" fixtures to the current namespace like this:\n   (use-fixtures :once fixture1 fixture2 ...)\n\n   Note: Fixtures and test-ns-hook are mutually incompatible.  If you\n   are using test-ns-hook, fixture functions will *never* be run.\n\n\n   SAVING TEST OUTPUT TO A FILE\n\n   All the test reporting functions write to the var *test-out*.  By\n   default, this is the same as *out*, but you can rebind it to any\n   PrintWriter.  For example, it could be a file opened with\n   clojure.java.io/writer.\n\n\n   EXTENDING TEST-IS (ADVANCED)\n\n   You can extend the behavior of the \"is\" macro by defining new\n   methods for the \"assert-expr\" multimethod.  These methods are\n   called during expansion of the \"is\" macro, so they should return\n   quoted forms to be evaluated.\n\n   You can plug in your own test-reporting framework by rebinding\n   the \"report\" function: (report event)\n\n   The 'event' argument is a map.  It will always have a :type key,\n   whose value will be a keyword signaling the type of event being\n   reported.  Standard events with :type value of :pass, :fail, and\n   :error are called when an assertion passes, fails, and throws an\n   exception, respectively.  In that case, the event will also have\n   the following keys:\n\n     :expected   The form that was expected to be true\n     :actual     A form representing what actually occurred\n     :message    The string message given as an argument to 'is'\n\n   The \"testing\" strings will be a list in \"*testing-contexts*\", and\n   the vars being tested will be a list in \"*testing-vars*\".\n\n   Your \"report\" function should wrap any printing calls in the\n   \"with-test-out\" macro, which rebinds *out* to the current value\n   of *test-out*.\n\n   For additional event types, see the examples in the code.\n","^D","^8","^E",17]],"^F",[["^ ","^:",30,"^;",true,"^<",235,"^=",235,"^>","~$clojure.template","^H",235,"^I",235,"^J","~$temp","^L","^2P","^@",14,"^A",14,"^M",35,"^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/test.clj","^N",39,"^D","^F","^E",235],["^ ","^:",32,"^;",true,"^<",236,"^=",236,"^>","^2Q","^H",236,"^I",236,"^J","^2R","^L","^2P","^@",14,"^A",14,"^M",37,"^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/test.clj","^N",42,"^D","^F","^E",236],["^ ","^:",28,"^;",true,"^<",237,"^=",237,"^>","^6?","^H",237,"^I",237,"^J","^7H","^L","^2P","^@",14,"^A",14,"^M",33,"^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/test.clj","^N",36,"^D","^F","^E",237]],"^S",[["^ ","^:",39,"^;",true,"^<",235,"^=",235,"^J","^DT","^L","^2P","^@",14,"^A",35,"^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/test.clj","^D","^S","^E",235,"^T","^DS"],["^ ","^:",42,"^;",true,"^<",236,"^=",236,"^J","^2R","^L","^2P","^@",14,"^A",37,"^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/test.clj","^D","^S","^E",236,"^T","^2Q"],["^ ","^:",36,"^;",true,"^<",237,"^=",237,"^J","^7H","^L","^2P","^@",14,"^A",33,"^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/test.clj","^D","^S","^E",237,"^T","^6?"]],"^U",[["^ ","^9",250,"^W",["^ "],"^:",15,"^;",true,"^<",250,"^=",250,"^2=","1.1","^X","^2P","^>","~$*load-tests*","^Z","^3U","^@",1,"^A",3,"^10","^3U","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/test.clj","^C",21,"^13","True by default.

Strings are objects (as opposed to sequences). As such, the\n   string being manipulated is the first argument to a function;\n   passing nil will result in a NullPointerException unless\n   documented otherwise. If you want sequence-y behavior instead,\n   use a sequence.\n\n2. Functions are generally not lazy, and call straight to host\n   methods where those are available and efficient.\n\n3. Functions take advantage of String implementation details to\n   write high-performing loop/recurs instead of using higher-order\n   functions. (This is not idiomatic in general-purpose application\n   code.)\n\n4. When a function is documented to accept a string argument, it\n   will take any implementation of the correct *interface* on the\n   host platform. In Java, this is CharSequence, which is more\n   general than String. In ordinary usage you will almost always\n   pass concrete strings. If you are doing something unusual,\n   e.g. passing a mutable implementation of CharSequence, then\n   thread-safety is your responsibility.","^D","^8","^E",9]],"^U",[["^ ","^V",["^1",[1]],"^9",52,"^W",["^ "],"^:",22,"^;",true,"^<",48,"^=",48,"^2=","1.2","^X","^6?","^>","~$reverse","^Z","^2?","^@",1,"^A",15,"^10","^2?","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/string.clj","^C",45,"^11",["[s]"],"^13","Returns s with its characters reversed.","^D","^U","^E",48],["^ ","^V",["^1",[1]],"^9",60,"^W",["^ "],"^:",35,"^;",true,"^<",54,"^=",54,"^2=","1.5","^X","^6?","^>","~$re-quote-replacement","^Z","^2?","^@",1,"^A",15,"^10","^2?","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/string.clj","^C",68,"^11",["[replacement]"],"^13","Given a replacement string that you wish to be a literal\n   replacement for a pattern match in replace or replace-first, do the\n   necessary escaping of special characters in the replacement.","^D","^U","^E",54],["^ ","^V",["^1",[3]],"^9",109,"^W",["^ "],"^:",22,"^;",true,"^<",75,"^=",75,"^2=","1.2","^X","^6?","^>","~$replace","^Z","^2?","^@",1,"^A",15,"^10","^2?","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/string.clj","^C",84,"^11",["[s match replacement]"],"^13","Replaces all instance of match with replacement in s.\n\n   match/replacement can be:\n\n   string / string\n   char / char\n   pattern / (string or function of match).\n\n   See also replace-first.\n\n   The replacement is literal (i.e. none of its characters are treated\n   specially) for all cases above except pattern / string.\n\n   For pattern / string, $1, $2, etc. in the replacement string are\n   substituted with the string that matched the corresponding\n   parenthesized group in the pattern.

This step\n  records details of problems found in the atoms d/failure-data.\n\n  (:return-value-checks opts) should be a sequence of functions that\n  each take the vector returned from calling clojure.core/pop, and\n  return data about any errors or warnings they find in the internals\n  of the vector data structure.  Errors or warnings are appended to\n  atoms d/failure-data and/or d/warning-data.\n\n  If either the validate or return value checks steps find an error,\n  they throw an exception if (:continue-on-error opts) is logical\n  false.\n\n  If the return value checks step finds no error, but does find a\n  warning, it throws an exception if (:continue-on-warning opts) is\n  logical false.","^D","^U","^E",886],["^ ","^V",["^1",[3]],"^9",971,"^W",["^ "],"^:",22,"^;",true,"^<",950,"^=",950,"^X","^?","^>","^1Q","^Z","^2?","^@",1,"^A",7,"^10","^2?","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/core.rrb-vector/0.1.1/core.rrb-vector-0.1.1.jar!/clojure/core/rrb_vector/debug.clj","^C",10,"^11",["[f err-desc-str coll]"],"^13","validating-pop! behaves the same as validating-pop, with the\n  differences described here.

a class\n\nKey features:\n\n* Exposes the read side of reflection as pure data. Reflecting\n  on a type returns a map with keys :bases, :flags, and :members.\n\n* Canonicalizes class names as Clojure symbols. Types can extend\n  to the TypeReference protocol to indicate that they can be\n  unambiguously resolved as a type name. The canonical format\n  requires one non-Java-ish convention: array brackets are <>\n  instead of [] so they can be part of a Clojure symbol.\n\n* Pluggable Reflectors for different implementations. The default\n  JavaReflector is good when you have a class in hand, or use\n  the AsmReflector for \"hands off\" reflection without forcing\n  classes to load.\n\nPlatform implementers must:\n\n* Create an implementation of Reflector.\n* Create one or more implementations of TypeReference.\n* def default-reflector to be an instance that satisfies Reflector.","^D","^8","^E",9]],"^F",[["^ ","^:",25,"^;",true,"^<",42,"^=",42,"^>","^?=","^H",42,"^I",42,"^J","^?>","^L","^IE","^@",14,"^A",14,"^M",30,"^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/reflect.clj","^N",33,"^D","^F","^E",42]],"^S",[["^ ","^:",33,"^;",true,"^<",42,"^=",42,"^J","^?>","^L","^IE","^@",14,"^A",30,"^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/reflect.clj","^D","^S","^E",42,"^T","^?="]],"^U",[["^ ","^9",46,"^W",["^ "],"^:",23,"^;",true,"^<",44,"^=",44,"^X","^IE","^>","~$Reflector","^Z","^;?","^@",1,"^A",14,"^10","^;?","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/reflect.clj","^C",36,"^13","Protocol for reflection implementers.","^D","^U","^E",44],["^ ","^V",["^1",[2]],"^9",46,"^W",["^ "],"^:",14,"^6C","^IE","^;",true,"^<",46,"^=",46,"^X","^IE","^>","~$do-reflect","^Z","^;?","^6E","^IF","^@",3,"^A",4,"^10","^;?","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/reflect.clj","^C",35,"^11",["[reflector typeref]"],"^D","^U","^E",46],["^ ","^9",54,"^W",["^ "],"^:",27,"^;",true,"^<",48,"^=",48,"^X","^IE","^>","~$TypeReference","^Z","^;?","^@",1,"^A",14,"^10","^;?","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/reflect.clj","^C",103,"^13","A TypeReference can be unambiguously converted to a type name on\n   the host platform.\n\n   All typerefs are normalized into symbols.

The interface will\n  have methods corresponding to the protocol functions, and the\n  protocol will automatically work with instances of the interface.\n\n  Note that you should not use this interface with deftype or\n  reify, as they support the protocol directly:\n\n  (defprotocol P \n    (foo [this]) \n    (bar-me [this] [this y]))\n\n  (deftype Foo [a b c] \n   P\n    (foo [this] a)\n    (bar-me [this] b)\n    (bar-me [this y] (+ c y)))\n  \n  (bar-me (Foo. 1 2 3) 42)\n  => 45\n\n  (foo \n    (let [x 42]\n      (reify P \n        (foo [this] 17)\n        (bar-me [this] x)\n        (bar-me [this y] x))))\n  => 17","^D","^U","^E",713],["^ ","^9",822,"^W",["^ "],"^:",13,"^;",true,"^<",777,"^=",777,"^2=","1.2","^X","^:C","^>","~$extend","^Z","^2?","^@",1,"^A",7,"^10","^2?","^B","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/core_deftype.clj","^C",82,"^11",["[atype & proto+mmaps]"],"^1W",1,"^13","Implementations of protocol methods can be provided using the extend construct:\n\n  (extend AType\n    AProtocol\n     {:foo an-existing-fn\n      :bar (fn [a b] ...)\n      :baz (fn ([a]...)

the confluently persistent vector data\n  structure introduced in Bagwell, Rompf, \"RRB-Trees: Efficient\n  Immutable Vectors\", EPFL-REPORT-169879, September, 2011.\n\n  RRB-Trees build upon Clojure's PersistentVectors, adding logarithmic\n  time concatenation and slicing.\n\n  The main API entry points are clojure.core.rrb-vector/catvec,\n  performing vector concatenation, and clojure.core.rrb-vector/subvec,\n  which produces a new vector containing the appropriate subrange of\n  the input vector (in contrast to clojure.core/subvec, which returns\n  a view on the input vector).\n\n  core.rrb-vector's vectors can store objects or unboxed primitives.\n  The implementation allows for seamless interoperability with\n  clojure.lang.PersistentVector, clojure.core.Vec (more commonly known\n  as gvec) and clojure.lang.APersistentVector$SubVector instances:\n  clojure.core.rrb-vector/catvec and clojure.core.rrb-vector/subvec\n  convert their inputs to clojure.core.rrb-vector.rrbt.Vector\n  instances whenever necessary (this is a very fast constant time\n  operation for PersistentVector and gvec; for SubVector it is O(log\n  n), where n is the size

Use :require in the ns macro\n  in preference to calling this directly.\n\n  Libs\n\n  A 'lib' is a named set of resources in classpath whose contents define a\n  library of Clojure code. Lib names are symbols and each lib is associated\n  with a Clojure namespace and a Java package that share its name. A lib's\n  name also locates its root directory within classpath using Java's\n  package name to classpath-relative path mapping. All resources in a lib\n  should be contained in the directory structure under its root directory.\n  All definitions a lib makes should be in its associated namespace.\n\n  'require loads a lib by loading its root resource. The root resource path\n  is derived from the lib name in the following manner:\n  Consider a lib named by the symbol 'x.y.z; it has the root directory\n  <classpath>/x/y/, and its root resource is <classpath>/x/y/z.clj, or\n  <classpath>/x/y/z.cljc if <classpath>/x/y/z.clj does not exist. The\n  root resource should contain code to create the lib's\n  namespace (usually by using the ns macro) and load any additional\n  lib resources.\n\n  Libspecs\n\n  A libspec is a lib name or a vector containing a lib name followed by\n  options expressed as sequential keywords and arguments.\n\n  Recognized options:\n  :as takes a symbol as its argument and makes that symbol an alias to the\n    lib's namespace in the current namespace.\n  :as-alias takes a symbol as its argument and aliases like :as, however\n    the lib will not be loaded. If the lib has not been loaded, a new\n    empty namespace will be created (as with create-ns).\n  :refer takes a list of symbols to refer from the namespace or the :all\n    keyword to bring in all public vars.\n\n  Prefix Lists\n\n  It's common for Clojure code to depend on several libs whose names have\n  the same prefix. When specifying libs, prefix lists can be used to reduce\n  repetition. A prefix list contains the shared prefix followed by libspecs\n  with the shared prefix removed from the lib names. After removing the\n  prefix, the names that remain must not contain any periods.\n\n  Flags\n\n  A flag is a keyword.\n  Recognized flags: :reload, :reload-all, :verbose\n  :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they are\n    already loaded (has no effect on libspecs using :as-alias)\n  :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that the\n    identified libs directly or indirectly load via require or use\n    (has no effect on libspecs using :as-alias)\n  :verbose triggers printing information about each load, alias, and refer\n\n  Example:\n\n  The following would load the libraries clojure.zip and clojure.set\n  abbreviated as 's'.\n\n  (require '(clojure zip [set :as s]))","^8","^9","^:",6038],["^ ","^;",["^<",[1]],"^=",6126,"^>",["^ "],"^?",24,"^@",true,"^A",6117,"^B",6117,"^C","1.10","^D","^E","^F","~$requiring-resolve","^1","^H","^3",1,"^4",7,"^5","^H","^6","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/core.clj","^7",79,"^I",["[sym]"],"^J","Resolves namespace-qualified sym per 'resolve'.

Clojure\n\nclojure.pprint implements a flexible system for printing structured data\nin a pleasing, easy-to-understand format. Basic use of the pretty printer is \nsimple, just call pprint instead of println. More advanced users can use \nthe building blocks provided to create custom output formats. \n\nOut of the box, pprint supports a simple structured format for basic data \nand a specialized format for Clojure source code. More advanced formats, \nincluding formats that don't look like Clojure data at all like XML and \nJSON, can be rendered by creating custom dispatch functions. \n\nIn addition to the pprint function, this module contains cl-format, a text \nformatting function which is fully compatible with the format function in \nCommon Lisp. Because pretty printing directives are directly integrated with\ncl-format, it supports very concise custom dispatch. It also provides\na more powerful alternative to Clojure's standard format function.\n\nSee documentation for pprint and cl-format for more information or \ncomplete documentation on the Clojure web site on GitHub.","^8","^41","^:",14]],"^44",[["^ ","^?",24,"^@",true,"^A",39,"^B",39,"^F","^5F","^46",null,"^47",null,"^4:","^6G","^3",12,"^4",12,"^4;",null,"^6","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/pprint.clj","^4<",null,"^8","^44","^:",39]]],"jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/core/IVecImpl.class",["^ ","^4H",[["^ ","^4I","clojure.core.IVecImpl","^6","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar!/clojure/core/IVecImpl.class","^8","^4H","^@",true,"^B",0,"^4",0,"^A",0,"^?",0]]],"jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/mvxcvi/puget/1.3.2/puget-1.3.2.jar!/puget/color.clj",["^ ","^41",[["^ ","^=",19,"^?",16,"^@",true,"^A",1,"^B",1,"^F","~$puget.color","^3",1,"^4",5,"^6","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/mvxcvi/puget/1.3.2/puget-1.3.2.jar!/puget/color.clj","^7",5,"^J","Coloring multimethods to format text by adding markup.\n\n  #### Color Options\n\n  `:print-color`\n\n  When true, ouptut colored text from print functions.\n\n  `:color-markup`\n\n  - `:ansi` for color terminal text (default)\n  - `:html-inline` for inline-styled html\n  - `:html-classes` for html with semantic classes\n\n  `:color-scheme`\n\n  Map of syntax element keywords to color codes.\n  ","^8","^41","^:",1]],"^9",[["^ ","^;",["^<",[3]],"^=",29,"^>",["^ "],"^?",15,"^@",true,"^A",24,"^B",24,"^D","^;D","^F","~$dispatch","^1","^H","^3",1,"^4",7,"^5","^H","^6","jar:file:///Users/matheus.nash/.m2/repository/mvxcvi/puget/1.3.2/puget-1.3.2.jar!/puget/color.clj","^7",30,"^I",["[options _element _text]"],"^J","Dispatches to coloring multimethods.

printing functions for rendering Clojure values. The following\n  options are available to control the printer:\n\n  #### General Rendering\n\n  `:width`\n\n  Number of characters to try to wrap pretty-printed forms at.\n\n  `:print-meta`\n\n  If true, metadata will be printed before values. Defaults to the value of\n  `*print-meta*` if unset.\n\n  #### Collection Options\n\n  `:sort-keys`\n\n  Print maps and sets with ordered keys. If true, the pretty printer will sort\n  all unordered collections before printing. If a number, counted collections\n  will be sorted if they are smaller than the given size. Otherwise,\n  collections are printed in their natural sort order. Sorted collections are\n  always printed in their natural sort order.\n\n  `:map-delimiter`\n\n  The text placed between key-value pairs in a map.\n\n  `:map-coll-separator`\n\n  The text placed between a map key and a collection value. The keyword :line\n  will cause line breaks if the whole map does not fit on a single line.\n\n  `:namespace-maps`\n\n  Extract common keyword namespaces from maps using the namespace map literal\n  syntax. See `*print-namespace-maps*`.\n\n  `:seq-limit`\n\n  If set to a positive number, then lists will only render at most the first n\n  elements. This can help prevent unintentional realization of infinite lazy\n  sequences.\n\n  `:coll-limit`\n\n  If set to a positive number, then collections will only render at most the\n  first n elements. This can help prevent unintentional printing of large\n  collections. Note: `:seq-limit` has higher precendence than `:coll-limit`\n  if both are set.\n\n  #### Color Options\n\n  `:print-color`\n\n  When true, ouptut colored text from print functions.\n\n  `:color-markup`\n\n  :ansi for ANSI color text (the default),\n  :html-inline for inline-styled html,\n  :html-classes to use the names of the keys in the :color-scheme map\n  as class names for spans so styling can be specified via CSS.\n\n  `:color-scheme`\n\n  Map of syntax element keywords to color codes.\n\n  #### Type Handling\n\n  `:print-handlers`\n\n  A lookup function which will return a rendering function for a given class\n  type. This will be tried before the built-in type logic. See the\n  `puget.dispatch` namespace for some helpful constructors. The returned\n  function should accept the current printer and the value to be rendered,\n  returning a format document.\n\n  `:print-fallback`\n\n  Keyword argument specifying how to format unknown values. Puget supports a few\n  different options:\n\n  - `:pretty` renders values with the default colored representation.\n  - `:print` defers to the standard print method by rendering unknown values\n    using `pr-str`.\n  - `:error` will throw an exception when types with no defined handler are\n    encountered.\n  - A function value will be called with the current printer options and the\n    unknown value and is expected to return a formatting document representing\n    it.\n  ","^8","^41","^:",1]],"^44",[["^
